# Image_retrival

## BoW method

* We use BoW method for image retrival, the training dataset is MNIST, and you can download the pictures from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dG1fhux)

* The dataset has 60000 pictures and we use scalar product to measure the similarity

* Each picture below contain 6 subpictures, and the first one is the query image, the others are top-5 pictures which are most similar(The first '7' only use 10000 trainning pictures's SIFT descriptors, and the second '8' use all 60000 trainning pictures's)
